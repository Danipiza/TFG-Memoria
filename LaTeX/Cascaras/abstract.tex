\vspace{1cm}

The work presented focuses on the optimization of Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms. By using MPI (Message Passing Interface), a standard library developed for high-performance computing.
The main objective, reduce the execution time of AI algorithms, through parallelization using distributed memory. It is a crucial task due to the high time and resource cost involved in training or running these models.

We initiate develving with an explanation of the theoretical foundations of the algorithms that will be implemented. Moreover, clarifying the functioning of the MPI library.
Once put in context, the strategies employed to enhance the algorithms are thoroughly elaborated upon.
And finally, an experimentation phase has been carried out to analyze the improvements developed throughout the project. This evaluation includes running the algorithms on a supercomputer with 128 cores.
