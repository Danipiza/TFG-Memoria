\vspace{1cm}

The work presented focuses on the optimization of Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms using MPI (Message Passing Interface), a standard library developed for high-performance computing.
The main objective consists in reducing the execution time of the algorithms, by exploiting the parallelism of computing resources and distributed memory. This task is especially relevant due to the high computational and resource cost involved in training or running these algorithms
This project includes a description of the theoretical foundations of the algorithms that will be implemented. Moreover, functioning of the MPI library is also presented.
Once put in context, the strategies employed to enhance the algorithms are described in detail.
In addition, an exhaustive empirical study has been carried out to analyze the developed strategies, which have been executed on a personal computer and in a high distributed system consisting of 128 CPU cores and 256 GB of RAM.
